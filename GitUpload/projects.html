        <p class = "firstparagraph">
            I Started a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice with my honours in 
            Electrical Engineering. Studying electrical engineering I was required to complete 
            modules such as fundementals of C, Introduction to data engineering and advanced digital 
            systems. During those studies I was required to complete projects in C, MATLAB and VHDL.

                Studying Introduction to data engineering I was required to learn MATLAB. My project 
                requirement was to use machine learning principles to optimise an engineering system.
                It was Population Based Incremental Learning using a PBIL Algorithm.</p>
                    
                    <p>My project required:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating an epoch of sample solutions.</li>
                            <li>Working out cost.</li>
                            <li>Ranking the epoch.</li>
                            <li>Updating the probability vector.</li>
                            <li>Going through a loop until cost is minimal</li>

                Studying fundementals of C I was required to design a database that stored peoples flights 
                and information. The scenario was Sydney Airport. I was required to store data in structures 
                using strings and pointers. </p>
                
               <p> My project had to: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add peoples names, addresses and flight details and save them in ram. </li>
                        <li>It was required to search for people using either name or flight number.</li>
                        <li>It had to print the name, dates and flights to a specific format.</li>
                        <li>It was required to store them on a database using fprintf and fscanf</li>
                        <li>The program had to have a menu and a selection method.</li>

                Studying Advanced Digital Systems I was required to program a FPGA cyclone IV equivalent to 
                the device shown in the image. The project required me to program the FPGA kit using 
                VHDL. The project required a 59 second count up and count down stop watch to be displayed on two
                of the seven segment displays. Furthermore to make things challenging we had to convert the 
                decimal number displayed to greycode on the remaining two displays.</p>
                
               
                    <p> This program required:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop truth tables for the outputs of the segments.</li>
                        <li>Develop FSM(finite state machines) to toggle between the 
                            different states.</li>
                        <li>Develop components such as multiplexes and shift registers
                            to simplify the main code.</li>
                        <li>There needed to be a reset button, start button, pause button
                            and a up and down switch. Also LED lights had to respond to requirements.</li>
